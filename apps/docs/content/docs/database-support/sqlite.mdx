# SQLite

data-peek supports SQLite databases for working with local database files.

## Opening a SQLite Database

1. Click **Add Connection** in the sidebar
2. Select **SQLite** as the database type
3. Click **Browse** to select your `.db`, `.sqlite`, or `.sqlite3` file
4. Click **Connect**

## Supported Features

| Table designer | ✓ |
| ER diagrams | ✓ |
| Query plans | ✓ |
| Views | ✓ |
| Foreign keys | ✓ |
| JSON support | ✓ |

## File-Based Access

SQLite is a serverless database that stores everything in a single file. Unlike PostgreSQL or MySQL, there's no network connection - data-peek reads and writes directly to the file on your computer.

### Supported File Extensions

- `.db`
- `.sqlite`
- `.sqlite3`
- `.s3db`

## Query Execution

### Single Statement

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = 1;
```

### Multiple Statements

Execute multiple statements in sequence:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John', 'john@example.com');
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
```

Each statement result is displayed in a separate result tab.

## Type Affinity

SQLite uses dynamic typing with type affinity. data-peek displays the following types:

| Affinity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| INTEGER | Whole numbers |
| REAL | Floating-point numbers |
| TEXT | Strings |
| BLOB | Binary data |
| NUMERIC | Numbers, dates, booleans |

## Query Plans

View query execution plans using SQLite's `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

Or use the **Explain** button in the query editor.

## Limitations

Since SQLite is file-based:

- **No SSH tunnels** - Direct file access only
- **No stored procedures** - SQLite doesn't support stored procedures
- **No sequences** - Use `AUTOINCREMENT` on INTEGER PRIMARY KEY instead
- **No custom types** - Use type affinity instead

## Use Cases

SQLite is ideal for:

- **Development databases** - Quick prototyping
- **Application data** - Inspecting app databases (mobile apps, Electron apps)
- **Data analysis** - Working with exported data
- **Testing** - Lightweight test databases

## Performance

SQLite handles databases up to several gigabytes efficiently. For databases exceeding 10+ GB or high-concurrency needs, consider PostgreSQL or MySQL.
