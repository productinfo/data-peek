## Multiple Result Sets

SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM orders;
```

## Stored Procedures

Browse and execute stored procedures from the schema explorer. Stored procedures appear under each schema in the sidebar.

## SSH Tunnel Support

Connect to SQL Server through an SSH tunnel for secure remote access. See [SSH Tunnels](/docs/features/ssh-tunnels) for configuration details.

## Connection String Options

data-peek uses the `mssql` Node.js driver. Advanced connection options can be configured in the connection dialog.

### Encryption

SSL/TLS encryption is enabled by default. For servers with self-signed certificates, you may need to configure trust settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Timeout

If connections are timing out, try:
- Verify the server is accessible from your network
- Check firewall rules allow connections on port 1433
- Ensure SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections

### Authentication Failures

- Verify your username and password
- Ensure the user has access to the specified database
- Check that SQL Server authentication is enabled on the server

### Certificate Errors

For self-signed certificates or internal servers, you may see certificate validation errors. Contact your database administrator for the correct SSL configuration.
