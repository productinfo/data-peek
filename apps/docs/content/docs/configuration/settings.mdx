# Settings

Access settings via `Cmd+,` (macOS) / `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux), or through the command palette (`Cmd+K` on macOS / `Ctrl+K` on Windows/Linux).

## Query Editor

### Hide Query Editor by Default

When enabled, table preview tabs open with the query editor collapsed. You can still expand it by clicking the editor header.

**Default:** Off

**Use Case:** Enable this if you primarily use data-peek for browsing data rather than writing queries.

## Quick Query Panel

### Hide Quick Query Panel by Default

When enabled, the quick query panel in the sidebar is hidden by default.

**Default:** Off

**Use Case:** Hide this if you prefer using the full query editor instead of quick queries.

## JSON Display

### Expand JSON by Default

When enabled, JSON columns automatically expand in the results viewer.

**Default:** Off

**Use Case:** Enable this if you frequently work with JSON data and want to see it expanded immediately.

## Database

### Query Timeout

Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a query to complete. Set to 0 for no timeout.

**Default:** 0 (no timeout)

**Use Case:** Set a timeout to prevent long-running queries from blocking your workflow. Useful when exploring unfamiliar databases.

### Cancel Running Queries

You can cancel a running query by clicking the **Cancel** button that appears during query execution. This works for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.

## AI Settings

AI settings are configured separately through the AI panel. See [AI Assistant](/docs/features/ai-assistant) for configuration details.

### Configurable Options

- **Provider**: OpenAI or Anthropic
- **API Key**: Your API key (stored securely in OS keychain)
- **Model**: Select from available models for your provider
