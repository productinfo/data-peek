# AI Assistant

data-peek includes a powerful AI assistant that helps you write SQL queries, generate charts, and get insights from your data.

## Getting Started

### Open the AI Panel

- Press `Cmd+I` (macOS) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux)
- Or click the sparkle icon in the toolbar
- Or use the command palette (`Cmd+K`) and search for "AI"

### Configure Your API Key

The AI assistant uses a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model. You need to provide your own API key:

1. Open AI Settings from the command palette or AI panel
2. Select your preferred provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or others)
3. Enter your API key
4. Click Save

Your API key is stored securely using your operating system's keychain.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Models (examples) |
|----------|-------------------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo |
| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus |

*Note: Available models may change as providers release updates. Check your provider's documentation for the latest model offerings.*

## Features

### Natural Language to SQL

Ask questions in plain English and get SQL queries:

> "Show me all users who signed up in the last 30 days"

The AI generates:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Schema-Aware Queries

The AI assistant understands your database schema. It knows your:
- Table names and structures
- Column names and types
- Relationships between tables

This means you can ask questions naturally:

> "How many orders does each customer have?"

### Chart Generation

Generate visualizations directly from your queries:

> "Show me a bar chart of monthly revenue for 2024"

The AI will:
1. Generate the appropriate SQL query
2. Execute it against your database
3. Create an interactive chart

Supported chart types:
- Bar charts
- Line charts
- Pie charts
- Area charts

### Query Explanations

Get explanations for complex queries:

> "Explain what this query does"

Paste any SQL and the AI will break down:
- What each part does
- How the joins work
- What the result will look like

### Safety Guardrails

The AI assistant includes safety features:
- **Destructive query warnings**: DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE queries show a confirmation dialog
- **Read-only by default**: Queries are analyzed before execution
- **Schema access only**: The AI can see schema structure but not your actual data

## Usage Tips

### Be Specific

More specific questions get better results:

| Less specific | More specific |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Show me users" | "Show me the top 10 users by order count" |
| "Get orders" | "Get orders from the last week with total > $100" |

### Reference Tables by Name

When your question could apply to multiple tables, be explicit:

> "Show me the status distribution of the **orders** table"

### Iterate on Results

You can refine queries in conversation:

1. "Show me all products"
2. "Filter to only in-stock items"
3. "Add the category name from the categories table"

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | macOS | Windows/Linux |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Open AI panel | `Cmd+I` | `Ctrl+I` |
| Send message | `Enter` | `Enter` |
| New line in message | `Shift+Enter` | `Shift+Enter` |

## Privacy & Security

- **BYOK model**: You use your own API key, so queries go directly to your chosen provider
- **Schema context**: Only schema metadata (table/column names and types) is sent to the AI, not your actual data
- **Local storage**: Conversation history is stored locally on your device
- **No telemetry**: data-peek doesn't collect or transmit your queries or results
- **Provider errors**: Error messages returned by AI providers are generated by those providers and may include contextual information about your request
