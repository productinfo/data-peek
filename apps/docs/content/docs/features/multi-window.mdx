# Multi-Window Support

data-peek supports multiple windows, allowing you to work with different databases or queries side by side.

## Opening New Windows

### From Menu

**File → New Window** or press `Cmd+Shift+N` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows/Linux)

### Use Cases

- Compare data across different databases
- Monitor one database while querying another
- Keep a reference query open while writing new ones
- Separate development and production databases

## Window Independence

Each window is fully independent:
- **Separate connections**: Each window can connect to a different database
- **Separate tabs**: Query tabs are window-specific
- **Separate history**: Query history is tracked per window
- **Separate results**: Results don't interfere between windows

## Window State

data-peek remembers window state:
- Window size and position
- Active connection per window
- Open tabs and their content

## Tips

### Organize by Environment

Keep separate windows for:
- Development database
- Staging database
- Production database (read-only queries)

### Side-by-Side Comparison

Use your OS window management to tile windows:
- **macOS**: Drag window to screen edge, or use Stage Manager
- **Windows**: Win+Arrow keys
- **Linux**: Varies by desktop environment

### Keyboard Navigation

When you have multiple windows:
- Cmd + backtick (`` ` ``) - Cycle through data-peek windows (macOS)
- `Alt+Tab` - Switch between windows (all platforms)
